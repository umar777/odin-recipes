    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With food prices ever on the rise, it makes sense to find ways to create delicious meals with your budget in mind. One way to do that is by using more canned beans. Canned beans are inexpensive, shelf-stable, and can be enjoyed in a multitude of ways.</p>
    <p>Talk about budget-friendly: Most canned beans cost between $1 to $2 for a 15-ounce can. A can typically provides three Â½-cup servings, which means that each serving (about 4 ounces) is around 33 to 66 cents! Compare that to boneless, skinless chicken breast, which comes in at around $1.00 per 4-ounce serving.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Minced Meat</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry the Minced meat</li>
        <li>Mix it with Sauce</li>
        <li>Put it in the Oven</li>
    </ol>
