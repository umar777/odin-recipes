    <h1>Burritos</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A burrito seems like an obvious choice for this list, but we love this particular recipe because it packs plenty of flavor, even with its low, $3-per-burrito price tag. The flavor starts with a sauté of garlic and onion–both inexpensive, flavor-filled aromatic vegetables. A hit of heat from jalapeño is balanced with the creamy addition of cream cheese and fresh cilantro. This one is so good that we think it may just be better than the $8 version you buy from your favorite restaurant chain.</p>
